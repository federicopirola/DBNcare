  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{a data.frame to be given as an input the to structure learning algorithm}

\item{test}{a character string, the label of the conditional independence test to be used in the algorithm test (default is \verb{Mutual Information} mi)}

\item{max.sx}{an integer, the maximum number of parents for each node (default is no limit)}

\item{blacklist}{a matrix with columns 'from' and 'to' defining the set of arcs that are forbidden}

\item{whitelist}{a matrix with columns 'from' and 'to' defining the set of arcs that are fixed}

\item{...}{additional parameters for the chosen test}
}
\value{
An object of class 'DBN', which is a DBN learned via Max-Min Parents and Children algorithm
}
